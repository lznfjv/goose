# Parameters
The chassis of the robot will be designed such that
- All selected components are easily mounted/unmounted
- The chassis is easily reproduced using any ordinary 3D printer
- Impact will not damage the frame
- Weight will not prevent the motors from functioning as expected
- Ventilation prevents overheating of any temperature-sensitive components

# Chassis
The chassis I'm currently working with is this:

This was created in Autodesk Fusion, and designed for easy printing on most common 3D printers. I've used ASA for its strength and UV resistance, but this could just as easily be produced with ABS or even PLA.

Lots of mounting holes are available, sized for M2 heat-set inserts. Heat-set inserts will allow the user to mount and unmount components as many times as they would like without worry of wearing out the threading on the 3D print itself. The inserts I use can be found here:

Each of the primary selected components has its own designated spot, with measurements taken to ensure precise mounting and no additional strain on the components.

The STEP file of the part is included.
