# PCA9685 Motor Controller Setup (Rock 5C)

This guide explains how to connect and test the PCA9685 PWM controller on the Radxa ROCK 5C.

The PCA9685 communicates using I2C.

# 1. Wiring

## ROCK 5C → PCA9685

| ROCK 5C Pin | Function | PCA9685 Pin |
|---|---|---|
| Pin 1 | 3.3V | VCC |
| Pin 9 | GND | GND |
| Pin 3 | I2C SDA | SDA |
| Pin 5 | I2C SCL | SCL |

Example:

```
ROCK 5C              PCA9685

Pin 3  SDA  -------> SDA

Pin 5  SCL  -------> SCL

Pin 1  3.3V -------> VCC

Pin 9  GND  -------> GND
```

---

# 2. Enable I2C

Install I2C tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install i2c-tools
```

Check available I2C buses:

```bash
ls /dev/i2c*
```

Example:

```
/dev/i2c-0
/dev/i2c-2
/dev/i2c-6
/dev/i2c-7
```

---

# 3. Find PCA9685 Address

The default PCA9685 address is:

```
0x40
```

Run:

```bash
sudo i2cdetect -y 6
```

If nothing appears, try:

```bash
sudo i2cdetect -y 0
sudo i2cdetect -y 2
sudo i2cdetect -y 7
sudo i2cdetect -y 8
sudo i2cdetect -y 9
```

Successful output:

```
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f

40: 40
```

This confirms the PCA9685 is connected.

**If for any reason you cannot find this 40, it means that it's hiding at another I2C port and you need to preform sudo rsetup --> Overlays --> Manage overlay --> and enable a different I2C (space key, dont enable all just one that you need). By my test its ENABLE I2C8-M2. It can be different so find the one that has the 40, then refer to that. Then you have to reboot the rock by sudo reboot.**

# 4. Install Python Libraries

Activate your environment:

```bash
cd ~/goose
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install libraries:

```bash
pip install adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685
pip install adafruit-blinka
```

---

# 5. Test PCA9685

Create:

```bash
nano pca_test.py
```

Paste:

```python
import board
import busio
from adafruit_pca9685 import PCA9685

i2c = busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)

pca = PCA9685(i2c)

pca.frequency = 100

print("PCA9685 detected!")

pca.deinit()
```

Run:

```bash
python pca_test.py
```

Expected:

```
PCA9685 detected!
```

---

# Troubleshooting

## PCA9685 not detected

Check:

1. SDA and SCL are not swapped.

Correct:

```
Pin 3 → SDA
Pin 5 → SCL
```

2. Check ground connection.

Both devices must share GND.

3. Check I2C address:

```bash
sudo i2cdetect -y <bus>
```

Expected:

```
40
```

## Motors do not move

Check:

- PCA9685 is detected
- Motor driver has external motor power
- Motor driver GND connects to ROCK 5C GND
- PWM channels match the code

## Current Motor Setup

PCA9685 Channels:

| Motor | IN1 | IN2 |
|-|-|-|
| Front Left | 0 | 1 |
| Rear Left | 2 | 3 |
| Rear Right | 4 | 5 |
| Front Right | 6 | 7 |
