# GooseBot - A hands-on, up-to-date alternative to the infamous Duckiebot
Author: Kevin Racktoo

Status: In progress. This document will be updated as the project progresses.

## Problem
There is a startling lack of robotics kits on the market which effectively guide students through the process of constructing and programming a modern robot.
Sure, there are options that provide opportunities for low-level programming of servos and motors, and others that demonstrate basic computer vision filtering techniques.
However, very few kits present the opportunity to thoroughly understand every element of the modern robot. GooseBot, or simply Goose, is an in-development project, designed to be
the ideal educational robotics kit, providing experience with real-world technologies that sticks because the procedures employed are exactly those used in the real-world.

## Objective
The GooseBot project kit will encompass the following topics with the objective of creating an autonomous ground-vehicle robot which closely emulates the functionality of a self-driving car.
- Hardware selection
-   Sensors
-   Chassis
-   Mechatronics
-   Power system
- Computer vision techniques
- Hardware acceleration using NPU
- Programming control of mechatronic components
- Sensor fusion

# Progress
See the respective subsections in this repo for further information.
- Hardware selection
- Chassis design
- Mounting and wiring
- Conversion of computer vision model for execution on NPU
- Execution of computer vision model on NPU
- Creation of dataset for specialized computer vision model
- Training of computer vision model on original dataset
