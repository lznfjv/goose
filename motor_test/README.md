# Objective
To ensure that the motors can be used effectively, we'll make a basic script that allows us to drive the robot around using keyboard controls.

# Scripts
## Mapping
As we don't know for certain which motor is mapped to which PWM channels and which of the two channels per motor is mapped to forward and backward. a basic script is written. It allows the user to easily determine directionality of the motors and channel mapping. This script is included in this section of the repo.

## Keyboard control
The keyboard control script is included in this section of the repo.
